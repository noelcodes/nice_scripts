# nice_scripts
I coded some nice scripts that works.
Most are just pre-processing work for training preparation.
- Like example moving files around respectively folder, rename files, etc..
- Some dataset collection scripts.
- Some web scripting codes.
- Some for pulling only faces as jpg
- Some pullng only certain images from video
- Some image pre-processing scripts
etc...
